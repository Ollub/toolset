# Production code
# A003 Forbid to use python builtins as class attrs
# C101 Magic comment
# D100 Docstring in public module
# D104 Docstring in public package
# D106 Docstring in public nested class
# D401 First line should be in imperative mood
# D412 No blank lines allowed between a section header and its content
# E203 No whitespaces before column (violates PEP8)
# W503 line break before binary operator
# WPS110 Forbid common names like data or items
# WPS115 Upper case constant in class
# WPS116 Found consecutive underscores name
# WPS121 Found usage of a variable marked as unused: _ (we use gettext)
# WPS202 Found too many module members
# WPS204 Found overused expression
# WPS211 Too many arguments
# WPS221 High Line Complexity
# WPS226 String constant over-use. In views a lot of swagger docs.
# WPS305 Forbid f-strings
# WPS306 Inherit from object
# WPS316 Context manager with more than one assignment
# WPS317 Found incorrect multi-line parameters
# WPS331 Found local variable that are only used in `return` statements
# WPS348 Found a line that starts with a dot
# WPS402 Found `noqa` comments overuse
# WPS420 Found wrong keyword (del, pass)
# WPS430 Found nested function
# WPS440 Found block variables overlap
# WPS510 Found `in` used with a non-set container
# WPS602 Found using `@staticmethod`
# WPS407 Found mutable module constant (in settings no sense)

# WPS410 __all__ in __init__.py
# WPS412 Logic in __init__.py. Only for specific files
# WPS201 Too many imports. Only for specific files. Drf views requires too many imports for example.
# WPS214 Too many methods. For user viewset.

# TESTS
# B010 Do not call setattr (for tests only)
# S101 Asserts are forbidden, but in tests we are using them
# S105 hardcoded password string
# S404 Consider possible security implications
# S603 subprocess without shell equals true
# S607 start process with partial path
# WPS118 Found too long name
# WPS204 overused expressions
# WPS226 String constant over-use. In tests a lot of partly same code.
# WPS442 Outer scope names shadowing. It conftest we have fixtures.
# PT011 set the match parameter (do not catch error messages)

inline-quotes = double
